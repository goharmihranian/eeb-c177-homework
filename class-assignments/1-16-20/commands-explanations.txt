Initially, I downloaded the zip file and extracted its contents
Then I moved the file by using "mv ~/Downloads/data-shell/ ~/Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/'
After, I moved into this directory to check if it was there by using 'cd ~/Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments'
I then did 'ls' to see if the data-shell contents were in the folder (they were).

Following the directions on the website:

'mkdir thesis'
'ls' to ensure "thesis" was made (it was)
'cd thesis' to move into the thesis folder
'nano draft.txt' to open a file named "draft.txt" 
I typed a few lines then did 'Ctrl-O' and pressed enter to save the text file
Followed by 'Ctrl-X' to exit the editor
'ls' to see if the "draft.txt" file had indeed saved to the thesis folder (it had)

'touch my_file.txt' created a new file without opening it 
'ls -l' showed me the 2 files I had made, along with their sizes
my_file.txt was 0 bytes since it had no data in it
'cd ..' to return to the data-shell contents

In order to change the name of the "draft.txt" file:
'mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt'
'ls thesis' to make sure it worked (it had): the file is now named "quotes.txt"
'mv thesis/quotes.txt .' was used to move "quotes.txt into the current working directory
'ls thesis' showed that the only file in the "thesis" folder was the "my_file.txt" we had generated earlier
'ls quotes.txt' showed that the "quotes.txt" was still in our current directory

Moving Files to a New Folder:
For this portion of the assignment, we don't have these folders so I am going to go through the commands as if we 
had these folders
'ls -F' showed that she had an "analyzed" folder and a "raw" folder 
'ls -F analyzed' showed the contents in the analyzed folder
she wants to move 2 files (sucrose.dat and maltose.dat) from the analyzed folder to the raw folder
'mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw' would move them from the current directory into the raw directory

Copying files and Directories
'cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt' copied this
'ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt' showed that it copied successfully


'cp -r thesis thesis_backup' copied the thesis file and made a new identical file called thesis_backup
'ls thesis thesis_backup' showed that both thesis and thesis_backup had the quotations.txt file within them

Renaming Files
'touch statstics.txt' to create misspelled file
'mv statstics.txt statistics.txt' to rename the file
'ls' to make sure the correctly spelled file was in the directory

Moving and Copying
'cd data' to move into the data folder
'touch proteins.dat' to create such a file
'mkdir recombine' to make a folder called recombine in the data folder (currently recombine and proteins.dat exist in the data folder)
'mv proteins.dat recombine/' to move proteins.dat into the recombine folder
'cp recombine/proteins.dat ../proteins-saved.dat' copied the proteins.dat as proteins-saved.dat into the class-assignments folder because that's the directory above data
'ls' only showed the recombine folder within the data folder
'cd ..' followed by 'ls' showed the proteins-saved.dat file in the class-assignments folder

Removing Files and Directories
'rm quotes.txt' deleted the file
'ls quotes.txt' showed that quotes.txt doesn't exist since it was deleted

'rm -i thesis_backup/quotations.txt' allows for a confirmation each time you delete something (reply with y or n for yes or no)
this is good so that you don't accidentally erase something, since it cannot be retrieved

'rm thesis' would delete thesis except rm by itself can't delete directories
'rm -r thesis' however would remove a directory
'rm -r -i thesis' would ask for confirmation, which is a good idea when deleting a directory

Operations With Multiple Files and Directories
'cd data' moves us into the data folder
'mkdir backup' creates a folder named backup within the data folder
'cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/' copies the files (amino-acids.txt and animals.txt) into the backup folder
'ls -F' shows the files in the data folder, which contains our backup folder we just made that contains the copies of the files

'cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt' gives an error message because you must copy files into a directory, which needs to be the last command you type (following what you're trying to copy)

Using Wildcards for Accessing Multiple Files at Once
'ls *t??ne.pdb' would give ethane.pdb and methane.pdb because the * tells us that there could be zero or more letters before the t and then the two ?? tells us that there must be two characters between the t and ne.pdb

More on Wildcards
'cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration'this copied all files ending in "-calibration.txt" to her backup folder
'cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/' this sent bob all of her november files
'cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/' and this sent bob all of her datasets created on a 23rd

Organizing DIrectories and FIles
In order to do these steps, I did the following:

'mkdir organzing' in class-assigments
'cd organizing'
'mkdir analyzed'
'mkdir raw'
'mkdir fructose.dat'
'mkdir sucrose.dat'
'ls' to make sure all of the files I just made were present

In order to put fructose.dat and sucrose.dat into her analyzed folder:
'mv *.dat analyzed' moved the files that ended in ".dat' to the analyzed folder
'ls' showed that only the analyzed and raw folders exist
'cd analyzed' followed by 'ls' to check if the files had transfered into analyzed folder

Reproduce A Folder Structure
'mkdir 2016-05-20' would create such a folder
'mkdir 2016-05-20/data' would create a data folder within the 2016-05-20 folder
'mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed' would create a processed folder within the other two previously mentioned folders
'mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw' would create another folder named raw within the data folder

OR you can do

'mkdir 2016-05-20' which will make this folder
'cd 2016-05-20' which will put you inside this folder
'mkdir data' would make a data folder within the 2016-05-20 folder
'cd data' would put you insdie the data folder
'mkdir raw processed' would make two separate folders named raw and processed, respectively in the data folder
