1) cd ~/Developer/repos/CSB/unix/data
   ls | wc -l
   ls | wc -l > pipe-data-lines.txt
2) cd miRNA
   cat *a_miR.fasta | wc -m > fasta-cat.txt
   git add -A
   git commit -m "completed 1 and 2 for part 3"
   git push origin master 
(I had to move these from the CSB repo into my own since it wouldn't let me push from someone elses)
 1) examined file and noticed everything was separated by a semicolon, which is the delimiter
    head PAcifici2013_data.csv
    nano Pacifici-delim.txt
    Ctrl-o
    Enter
    Ctrl-x
    (also moved this to my repo in homework-two and then did the git push workflow shown in number 2 above)
 2) cat Pacifici2013_data.csv | head -n 10 | cut -d ";" -f 3
    

1) tail -5 Pacifici2013_data.csv
   tail +2 Pacifici2013_data.csv
2) head -n 10 Pacifici2013_data.csv | tail +2 > Pacifici-ten.txt
3) cd ~/Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/homework-two
